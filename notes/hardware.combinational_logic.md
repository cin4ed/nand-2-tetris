# Combinational logic

In automata theory, combinational logic is a **type of digital** logic which is implemented by boolean circuits
where the output is a pure function of the **present input only**.

This is in contrast to sequential logic, in which the output depends not only on the present input but also on
the history of the input. In other words, sequential logic has memory while combinational logic does not.

Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform boolean algebra on input signals and on stored data.
Practical computer circuits normally contain a mixture of combinational and sequential logic.

For example, the part of an arithmetic logic unit, or ALU, that does mathematical calculations is constructed
using combinational logic. Other circuits used in computers, such as:

- Half adders
- Full adders
- Half subtractors
- Full subtractors
- Multiplexers
- Encoders
- Decoders

are also made by using combinational logic.
