# Boolean algebra

Boolean arithmetic  -> boolean algebra

Elementary algebra uses arithmetic operators such as addition, multiplication, substraction and division.

Boolean algebra is therefore a formal way of describing logical operations, in the same way that elementary
algebra describes numerical operations.

Boolean algebra was introduced by George Boole in his first book "The mathematical analysis of logic" 1847.

## Operations

It differs from elementary algebra in two ways:

1. The values of the variables are the truth values *true* and *false*.
2. Boolean algebra uses logic operators such as conjunction (*and*), disjunction (*or*) an the negation (*not*).

Is said that the basic operations of boolean algebra are conjunction, disjunction, and negation. But one might
consider that only negation and one of the two other operations are basic, because of the following identities
that allow one to define conjunction in terms of negation and the disjunction, and vice versa (*De Morgan's Laws*).

- $x \land y = \neg (\neg x \lor \neg y)$
- $x \lor y = \neg (\neg x \land \neg y)$

There are  more operations called *secondary operations*, these operations are composed from basic operations:

- Material conditional
- Material biconditional
- Exclusive OR (**XOR**)
- Material conditional
- Logical equivalence 

## Laws

Laws are a set of fundamental rules or principles that define how boolean variables and operations behave. These
laws are essential for **simplyfing** and manipulating boolean expressions and functions.

Some of the most important boolean algebra laws include:

- Identity laws
- Null laws
- Domination laws
- Indemponent laws
- Commutative laws
- Associative laws
- Distributive laws
- De Morgan's Laws

## Furthermore

- Monotome laws 
- Nonmonotone laws 
- Completeness 
- Duality principle 
- Venn diagrams 
- Digital logic gates
