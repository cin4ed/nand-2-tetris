# Logic gate

A logic gate is an idealilzed or physical device that performs a boolean function, a logical operation
performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output.

Depending on the context, the term may refer to an **ideal logic gate**, one that has, for instance, zero
**rise time** and unlimited **fan-out**, or it may refer to a non-ideal physical device. 

In the real world, the primary way of building logic gates uses diodes or transistors acting as electronic
switches. Today, most logic gates are made from MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors).
They can also be constructed using vacuum tubes, electromagnetic relays with relay logic, fluid logic,
pneumatic logic, optics, molecules, or even mechanical elements.

In an 1886 letter, Charles Sanders Peirce described how logical operations could be carried out by electrical
switching circuits. Early electromechanical computers were constructed from switches and relay logic rather
than the later innovations of vacuum tubes (thermonic valves) or transistors.
